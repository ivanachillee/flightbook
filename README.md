# Flightbook: Will your next flight be delayed?
Flight delays are unpleasant, and definitely a thing that most would want to avoid. Would you like to know beforehand, when booking, if your flight is going to be delayed, and how long? 


## Overview
This project makes use of the [RITA dataset by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) in order to analyse the different causes of airline delays across +1.9M of different flights. The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights appears in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, published about 30 days after the month's end, as well as in summary tables posted on this website. BTS began collecting details on the causes of flight delays in June 2003. Summary statistics and raw data are made available to the public at the time the Air Travel Consumer Report is released.
